<h1>Inactive Project</h1>
<p>This project was horribly developed; however, it got the job done for those of us who didn't want to spend a penny on other costly servcies. I learned a lot from this project (ie: customer relationship, JavaScript, databases) and the experiences that I've gained from this venture have helped me with other repositories found on my GitHub profile.</p>
<br><br>
<b>Some neat statistics include:</b>
<ul>
  <li>25,000 clones</li>
  <li>55,000 unique visitors</li>
  <li>$500 in donations</li>
</ul>
