### About
Finally, a service that doesn't charge its users for something so essential and simple.

Auxiliary is an open-sourced Discord-ROBLOX integration bot which allows users to manage their clans through their communication guild.
This service is similar to a paid service (Clan Labs); however, this service doesn't charge people and it's completely open-sourced meaning
users can opt in to host this service by themselves (for free).

Additionally, the service is hosted by the development team allowing users to opt in to our services (project-based)--meaning, we'll allot
one slot to the user for their group and in return, we don't expect much.  We take donations and service reviews, but to reiterate..
nothing is expected in return of our services.
