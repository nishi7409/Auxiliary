### About
Finally, a service that doesn't charge its users for something so essential and simple.

Auxiliary is an open-sourced Discord-ROBLOX integration bot which allows users to manage their clans through their Discord guild.
This service is similar to a paid one; however, this service doesn't charge people and it's completely open-sourced meaning
users can host this service by themselves--for free.
